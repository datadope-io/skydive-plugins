# Skydive plugin probes repository

Work In Progress

This repository hosts probe plugins. Probe Plugins can be Agent and/or Analyzer
probe, please check probe README file for more details.

# Installation

Just run `make` to compile all the plugins or enter to sub directory to compile specific one.

# Examples

You can have a look at the `sample` plugin which brings the minimal required to write a probe or the `memory` one, 
a bit more complex but still simple registering real data structure and live updating the Skydive graph.
